## Aim:
The UX Design Experiment aims to address critical user experience issues in two real-world digital design contexts:

Health & Wellness App Design: The goal is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly mobile application that motivates users to build healthier habits by integrating multiple health tracking features (exercise, sleep, water intake, etc.) and offering personalized recommendations. The app should reduce fragmentation and help users maintain consistency in their health routines.

Government Service Portal Redesign: The goal is to revamp an outdated and confusing government web portal used for essential services such as license renewal and vehicle registration. The redesigned portal should focus on improving navigation, simplifying language, minimizing form complexity, and enhancing accessibility for non-tech-savvy users and senior citizens.

## Algorithm:
Identify user pain points through interviews, surveys, and real-world observation. Define UX problem statements based on specific user needs. Choose suitable research methods: Health App: Interviews, Surveys, Usability Testing. Gov Portal: Contextual Inquiry, Heuristic Evaluation, Surveys. Create user personas to represent typical users and their goals. Use insights to inform design improvements for usability, personalization, and accessibility.
